# IndianColor.Restaurant
This code is to develop website for a restaurant. 
The goal is to make the website very much generic, so that it can be used by any restaurant.
We have plan to use technologies like Entity Framework, oAuth.
This is using ASP.Net MVC framework.
For Database we will use MS SQL server or MySQL database software.
